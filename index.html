<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>This document presents a set of best practices for publishing statistics on the Web following the linked data principles. These practices aim at supporting data publishers
to model their data and to apply common linked data standards. The wide adoption of such practices can increase interoperability among portals of statistical data 
on the Web, and thus facilitate the integration of relevant datasets as well as the development of generic software tools that can be reused across different datasets.

  </p>

<h2 id="status">Status of this Document</h2>

<p>The aim of this document is to trigger and contribute to a discussion on the development of a set of best practices for publishing statistics on the Web. 
It describes the results of a research work conducted by CERTH in the course of the OpenGovIntelligence project.</p> 

<p>The approach that was followed comprises two steps:
<ul> 
<li>an analysis of official linked statistical data portals (i.e. the <a target="_blank" href="http://statistics.gov.scot">Scottish Government portal</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://opendatacommunities.org">DCLG portal</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://digital-agenda-data.eu/data">European Commission's Digital Agenda portal</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://datiopen.istat.it">ISTAT portal</a>,and the <a target="_blank" href="http://data.cso.ie"> the Irish CSO portal</a>) to identify conflicting publishing approaches, and </li>
<li>the involvement of experts to provide their feedback and contribute to the comprehension of the publishing approaches as well as to the definition of the best practices. Towards 
this direction the Delphi method was employed using a questionnaire with multiple iterations to collect feedback until a stability in the responses was attained </li>
</ul>

The best practices described in this document have been categorised into nine categories based on the main decision that a data publisher should make about the way that they model their data and apply relevant linked data standards. 
The challenges of each category are described along with the main alternatives that can be employed to address these challenges. Finally, a best practice per challenge
is presented as the most promising approach among all the alternatives. We should also note that several challenges have not been covered and thus open issues still remain to be explored.

<h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>International organizations, National Statistical Institutes, and public authorities are increasingly opening up their statistical data through Web portals for others to reuse. 
Recently, many of these portals (e.g. the Italian and Irish National Statistical Institutes portals, the Flemish Government portal and the Scottish Government portal)  
have adopted the linked data principles that facilitates data integration on the Web through the reuse of standard Web technologies such as HTTP, RDF and URIs and standard vocabularies such as RDF data cube, SKOS and XKOS. 
However, the flexibility of these standards enables statistical data portals to follow different publishing approaches, thus causing interoperability conflicts. 
The result is the creation of linked statistical data silos that hamper the integration and combination of related statistical data from different portals as wells as the development of generic exploitation tools (e.g. visualizations) 
that can be reused across different portals. </p>

<h2 id="runningexample">6. Running Example</h2>

<div class="example">
John works for the National Statistical Institute of Belgium and is in charge of publishing
 statistical data about unemployment and poverty in the regions of Belgium for the last year.
 These data refer to various groups of people based on their age and gender. John wants to publish 
 these data using linked data technologies and standards in order to be open and reusable.
 These data are multidimentional and thus they should be modeled as a cube. John needs to define
 its measures, units, dimensions and code lists. Some of the challenges he faces are: i) 
 the definition of multiple measures (unemployment, poverty) per cube and ii) the definition 
 of multiple units (percentage, count) per measure. Finally, John needs the data to be interoperable
 with open statistical data both inside and outside Belgium. Towards this end he wants to reuse standard
 vocabularies and code lists.

    <p class="practicedesc">John needs to define a measure e.g. unemployment. He is wondering what is the best way to do is.</p>

    <section class="axioms" typeof="bibo:Chapter" resource="#challenge-1" property="bibo:hasPart">
		<h4 class="subhead" id="ch-1" resource="#ch-1"><span property="xhv:role" resource="xhv:heading">Challenge</span></h4>
		<p>The cube measure represents the phenomenon being observed (e.g. unemployment). At the QB vocabulary measures are RDF properties
		of qb:MeasureProperty type, they are defined at the cube structure (qb:DataStructureDefinition) and are used to assign			numerical values at the observations (e.g. unemployment = 7.8%). The selection of the measure property may lead into two
			types of conflicts:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Homonym conflicts appear when the same measure property is used to represent different measures. 
				For example the Scottish Government, defines the generic measure properties count and ratio
				(i.e. http://statistics.gov.scot/def/measure-properties/count and 
				http://statistics.gov.scot/def/measure-properties/ratio) to represent different measures. In this case,
				the phenomenon being observed is modeled as a unit.</li>
			<li>Synonym conflicts appear when different measure properties (e.g. test:unemployment and eg:unemployment)
				represent the same measure. </li>
		</ul>
		Both types of conflict appear at the existing approaches. These approaches make use of the generic measure proposed by the
		SDMX vocabulary (i.e. sdmx-measure:obsValue) in two ways: 
		
		<p><u>Re-use sdmx-measure:obsValue as a measure</u>. In this case homonym conflicts appear,
		since the same measure property represents different measures. This approach has many disadvantages:
		i) it requires additional meta-data to indicate what is measured, ii) it does not enable the use of multiple
		measures at a cube and iii) it prevents the linking with other cubes. However, sdmx-measure:obsValue facilitates
		the conversion of existing SDMX data to the QB vocabulary.</p>
		<aside class="example">
			<img src="images/bp1_eg1.jpg" width=500>

			</pre>			
		</aside>
		
		<p><u>Define a new measure property that is also a sub-property of sdmx-measure:obsValue.</u> In this case both
		homonym and synonym conflict may appear. Homonym conflicts appear when the new measure property is generic 
		(e.g. count, ratio), while synonym conflicts appear when two different measure properties model the same measure 
		(e.g. unemployment). Moreover, defining the new measure property as sub-property of sdmx-measure:obsValue is a redundancy
		because it does not add any additional semantics than defining the measure as a qb:MeasureProperty.</p>

	<p><span id="definingTheUnit" class="practicelab">BP2: Defining the unit</span></p>
    <p class="practicedesc">John has already defined unemployment as the measure of his cube. Now he is wondering a) whether or not to include the unit of the measure in the cube, 
      b) what RDF property to use to define the unit c) where to define the unit and d) what values to assign.</p>

    <section class="axioms" typeof="bibo:Chapter" resource="#challenge-2.1" property="bibo:hasPart">
		<h4 class="subhead" id="ch-2.1" resource="#ch-2.1"><span property="xhv:role" resource="xhv:heading">Challenge 2.1</span></h4>
    <p>The measure on its own is a plain numerical value. To correctly interpret this value we need to define the unit i.e. the quantity or increment by which the measure is counted or described. However, it is a common practice to not use units of measure (e.g. the portal of the Italian National Institute of Statistics http://datiopen.istat.it/). </p>
    </section>
    <section class="axioms" typeof="bibo:Chapter" resource="#challenge-2.2" property="bibo:hasPart">
		<h4 class="subhead" id="ch-2.2" resource="#ch-2.2"><span property="xhv:role" resource="xhv:heading">Challenge 2.2</span></h4>
    <p>At the QB vocabulary, units can be modeled as RDF properties of qb:AttributeProperty type that are defined at the cube structure (qb:DataStructureDefinition). The selection of the unit property may lead to synonym conflicts since different properties can be used for the same purpose. A common practice to address this challenge is to re-use sdmx-attribute:unitMeasure property. In practice however, new properties are defined as sub-properties of sdmx-attribute:unitMeasure hindering this way interoperability. For example, many existing portal follow this approach: </p>
		<aside class="example">
			<pre>
 :unit a qb:AttributeProperty;
         rdfs:subPropertyOf sdmx-attribute:unitMeasure.
 :dsd a qb:DataStructureDefinition;
         qb:component [qb:attribute :unit].

		<h4 class="subhead" id="ch-2.3" resource="#ch-2.3"><span property="xhv:role" resource="xhv:heading">Challenge 2.3</span></h4>
    <p>The QB vocabulary enables the definition of units at different levels i.e. at the qb:DataSet, at the qb:MeasureProperty and at the qb:Observation. By default units are assigned to qb:Observations, however using the property qb:componentAttachment different levels can also be used. In particular the options are:</p>
    <p><u>Define the unit at the qb:DataSet.</u> In this case the querying of available units is facilitated since units can easily be identified directly from the structure of the cube. However, if multiple units are defined at the same cube, then there is no way to map the unit with the values at the qb:Observation. Another disadvantage of this approach is that qb:Observations cannot easily be re-used at another context, because they do not contain all the relevant information i.e. the unit is missing.</p>
		<aside class="example">

 :unemployment a qb:MeasureProperty.
 :dsd a qb:DataStructureDefinition;
         qb:component [qb:attribute  sdmx-attribute:unitMeasure;

    <p><u>Define the unit at the qb:MeasureProperty.</u> In this case the querying of available units is also facilitated since units can be identified directly from the structure. Moreover, multiple units can be assigned at a cube. However, different qb:MeasureProperty should be defined for different units although they represent the same measure, thus hindering interoperability e.g. two separate qb:MeasureProperty should be defined for unemployment, one assigned to percentage and another assigned to the absolute number. In this case qb:Observations cannot easily be re-used at another context, because they do not contain all the relevant information i.e. the unit is missing.</p>

    <p>The values of the unit property (e.g. percentage) can be expressed using predefined URIs (e.g. http://qudt.org/vocab/unit#Percent). However, the use of different URIs to express the same unit creates synonym conflicts e.g. both http://qudt.org/vocab/unit#Percent and http://statistics.gov.scot/def/concept/measure-units/percentage define percentage.  </p>
    <p>Three approaches are commonly used to express the unit values:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use URIs from the QUDT units vocabulary</li>
      <li>Use URIs from DBpedia</li>
      <li>Define a new code list</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All approaches are equally used by existing official portals. However, DBpedia is only used for currency units (e.g. http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pound_sterling).</p>
    <p>As a result the challenges related to units are the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Should we include the unit of the measure in the cube?</li>
      <li>How to define a unit property?</li>
      <li>Where to define the unit?</li>

    <p>It is a common practice to have data with multiple units for the same measure (e.g. percentage and absolute number for unemployment). In this case there are two modeling approaches that can be followed and are valid according to the QB vocabulary:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>Publish multiple cubes with one unit each</li>
      </ul></p>
     <p>The selection of the approach to be followed is affected by the level where the unit is defined as described in challenge 2.3. For example, if multiple units for the same measure are defined at the qb:DataSet, then there is no way to map the units with the values at the qb:Observation. Thus, the definition of multiple units at the qb:DataSet should be avoided.</p>

John is wondering whether to publish the data about unemployment and poverty at the same cube or publish separate cubes. In the case that both measures are included at the same cube, he is also wondering what is the best way to do so, considering that the measures have multiple units (percentage and absolute number).</p>

    <p>It is a common practice to have data with multiple measures (e.g. unemployment and poverty). In this case, there are two modeling approaches that can be followed and are valid according to the QB vocabulary:
      <ul>
        <li>Publish multiple cubes with one measure each </li>
        <li>Include all measures at one cube </li>
      </ul></p>
     <p>The first approach is covered by BP2 (measure with one unit) and at BP3 (measure with multiple units).</p>
     <p>Considering the second approach (multiple measures at one cube), the QB vocabulary proposes two practices to represent multiple measures: </p>
     <p><u>Multi-measure observations:</u> Define multiple qb:MeasureProperty at the data structure definition and use all measures to every qb:Observation. By defining all the measures at one observation, this practice reduces the size of the produced cube. However, a limitation of this practice is that it does not allow the association of an attribute property (e.g. unit) to a single measurement. An attribute property attached to the observation will apply to all measurements, thus it cannot represent multiple measures with multiple units.</p> 
     <aside class="example">

			</pre>			
		</aside>
    <p><u>Measure dimension:</u> Define multiple qb:MeasureProperty at the data structure definition, but restrict observations to having a single measure. This is achieved by defining an extra dimension, the qb:measureType, to denote which particular qb:MeasureProperty is included at the qb:Observation. The use of a single measure at observations produces a large number of observations, thus increasing the size of the produced cube. However, this practice enables the definition of multiple units and multiple measures.</p>

    <p>Dimensions (e.g. geography, time) provide contextual information for the measures of the cube. At the QB vocabulary, dimensions are RDF properties of qb:DimensionProperty type and are defined at the cube structure (qb:DataStructureDefinition). The selection of the RDF property to represent a dimension may lead to synonym conflicts since different properties can be used for the same purpose. A common practice to address this challenge is to re-use dimensions defined by the linked data version of SDMX (e.g. sdmx-dimension:refArea)</p>
    <p>The time, geography, age and gender dimensions are very common at statistical data, thus the linked data version of SDMX has already defined qb:DimensionProperties to express them i.e. sdmx-dimension:refPeriod, sdmx-dimension:refArea, sdmx-dimension:age and sdmx-dimension:sex. These SDMX dimensions are not associated with the valid potential values (i.e. code list or range). A special case is the sdmx-dimension:sex dimension because a code list has already been defined and associated with the dimension.</p>
    <p>In practice however, new dimensions are defined as sub-properties of the SDMX dimensions hindering this way interoperability. An advantage of this approach is the fact that it enables the addition of extra annotation to the dimensions (e.g. label, code list, range).</p>

    <p>Dimension values can be either data types (e.g. xsd:dateTime) or URIs. Currently, many reference datasets have been defined to populate dimensions (e.g. time). However, some of them (e.g. reference.data.gov.uk) are not modeled as skos:ConceptScheme, skos:Collection  or  qb:HierarchicalCodeList.</p>
    <p>The QB vocabulary allows two complementary approaches for defining the valid potential values of dimensions.</p>
    <p><u>Use the property rdfs:range</u> to define the type of valid values of a qb:DimensionProperty  in the usual RDF manner. For example the values of the time dimension can be defined using as rdfs:range the xsd:dateTime.</p>
    <p><u>Use the property qb:codeList</u> to associate a qb:DimensionProperty with a code list (i.e. potential values). In statistical data sets it is common for values to be encoded using a code list and it is useful to easily identify the overall code list with a URI. The values of the qb:codeList can be a skos:ConceptScheme, skos:Collection or qb:HierarchicalCodeList. In such a case the rdfs:range can be a skos:Concept. According to the QB vocabulary a useful design pattern is to define an rdfs:Class whose members are all the skos:Concepts within a particular code list. In that way the rdfs:range can be made more specific.</p>

    <p>The use of the qb:codeList indicates all the potential values of a qb:DimensionProperty. However, it is common to not use all the values at the cube. For example, a code list may contain values for the geography of Europe, but the cube uses only values for Greece. In this case there is no way to retrieve only the used values from the cube structure. They can be only retrieved by iterating over all the cube observations that is a time consuming process.</p>

    <p>It is common code list to include data with a hierarchical structure (e.g. geographical divisions). Thus, they can be represented using hierarchies that consist of generalization/specialization relations (e.g. Brussels isPartOf Belgium) and levels (e.g. country, region, city). In practice however, sometimes the hierarchical data are represented flat in a code list without generalization/specialization relations.</p>
    <p>The selection of the properties to represent generalization/specialization relations and levels may lead to synonym conflicts since different properties can be used for the same purpose. At linked statistical data the following approaches exist to represent hierarchical code lists:</p>
	<p><u>Use SKOS vocabulary.</u> This approach defines only generalization/specialization relations i.e. skos:broader and skos:narrower.</p>
	<aside class="example">
			<img src="images/bp9.2_eg1.jpg" width=500>
			<pre>
:Belgium a skos:Concept.
:Brussels a skos:Concept;
            skos:broader :Belgium.
:Wallonne a skos:Concept;
            skos:broader :Belgium.
			</pre>
	</aside>		
	<p><u>Use XKOS vocabulary.</u> XKOS is an extension of SKOS that enables also the modeling of both generalization/specialization relations (i.e. xkos:isPartOf, xkos:hasPart) and hierarchical levels (i.e. xkos:ClassificationLevel).</p>		
	<aside class="example">
		<img src="images/bp9.2_eg2.jpg" width=700>
		<pre>
:Belgium a skos:Concept.
:Brussels a skos:Concept;
            xkos:isPartOf :Belgium.
:Wallonne a skos:Concept;
            xkos:isPartOf :Belgium.
:Country a xkos:ClassificationLevel;
           skos:member : Belgium.
:Region a xkos:ClassificationLevel;
           skos:member :Brussels;
           skos:member :Wallonne.
			</pre>
	</aside>
	
	<p><u>Use QB vocabulary.</u> In this case a qb:HierarchicalCodeList should be defined that is similar to a skos:ConceptScheme. The qb:hierarchyRoot plays the same role as skos:hasTopConcept, and the value of qb:parentChildProperty plays the same role as skos:narrower. This approach is provided for cases where the terms are not available as SKOS but are available in some other RDF representation suitable for reuse.</p>
	<aside class="example">
		<img src="images/bp9.2_eg3.jpg" width=900>
		<pre>
:BEgeo a qb:HierarchicalCodelist;
            qb:parentChildProperty :within;
            qb:hierarchyRoot :Belgium;
            qb:hierarchyRoot :Brussels;
            qb:hierarchyRoot :Wallone.
:Belgium a skos:Concept.
:Brussels a skos:Concept;
            :within :Begium.
:Wallonne a skos:Concept;
            :within :Begium.
			</pre>
	</aside>
	<p>Sometimes, case-specific properties are exploited to express hierarchies. This approach enables the definition of generalization/specialization relations and hierarchical levels without using any standard vocabulary. Thus, the interpretation of the data is not straightforward. </p>

    <p>"Τotal" values are often used at dimensions (e.g. male, female, total). They facilitate the processing of the data because there is no need to make aggregations to compute them on the fly. However, “total" values should somehow be differentiated from other values, otherwise there is a risk of false interpretation of the data (e.g. duplicate the values). In practice however, “total” values are often flat on the same code list e.g. the linked data version of SDMX contains the values sdmx-code:sex-F, sdmx-code:sex-M and sdmx-code:sex-T (total) without any distinction for the “total” value. The following practices have been proposed to distinguise “total” values.</p>
    
	<p><u>Use a hierarchy and deﬁne total values at the top of the hierarchy.</u> The practice to use to express the hierarchy depends on challenge 9.2</p>
	
	<aside class="example">
		<img src="images/bp9.3_eg1.jpg" width=700>
		
	</aside>
	
	<p><u>Put total on slices.</u> The total  value for a dimension is represented by leaving out this dimension from the slice. The example shows a slice that defines the total unemployment  (35.9%) for all the people (male and female) with age 15-24, at Brussels the year 2016.</p>
	<aside class="example">

	<p><u>BP9.2: In the case of hierarchical data always use hierarchies to describe them. SKOS  should be preferred when the hierarchies are simple. In the case where levels are fully separated and a depth is a meaningful concept then XKOS is appropriate. Finally, when there is a need to express more relations not covered by SKOS or XKOS (e.g. administeredBy vs within) then QB vocabulary should be preferred.</u></p>
